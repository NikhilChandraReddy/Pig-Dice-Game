## How to Play

The Pig Dice Game is a two-player game where the goal is to score 100 points, before your opponent does. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. Here are the basic rules:

1. Each turn, a player can roll a six-sided dice as many times as they want and accumulate points from the rolls.
2. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and it's the other player's turn.
3. A player can choose to "Hold" to add their current turn's points to their total score and pass the turn to the other player.
4. The first player to reach the target score wins the game.
